# Bone-Marrow-Transplantation-ML-Pipelines
In this project, we will be using a dataset containing bone marrow transplantation characteristics for pediatric patients from UCIâ€™s Machine Learning Repository.

We will this dataset to build a pipeline, containing all preprocessing and data cleaning steps, and then selecting the best classifier to predict patient survival.

## 1. Numeric Data Cleaning: 
### Output:
pipeline_arr == np_arr: True
pipeline_arr_med - np_arr_med = 43.36075966952346
